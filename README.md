**Project 1**

**Description:** For the first project we had the task of creating a link-layer protocol that would be used by a test application (created by us) to transfer files between two computeres connected by a serial port. We were able to produce a program that implemented both protocols and that was resistant to errors(disconnecting and reconnecting serial port mid-transmission and introducing electric interference on the connection).

**Technologies:** C, Unix Standard Library

**Skills:** Network programming, C low level system programming, OSI model, data link protocol, application protocol, serial connection, fault tolerance in network transmissions

**Grade:** 18/20

**Project 2**

**Description:** For the second project we created a application that was able to download a file by implementing the FTP protocol (using sockets). We then used switches, routers and computers available in the network laboratory to create a small network architecture (with two VLANs, switches, NAT) where the application would be used.

**Technologies:** C, Unix Standard Library

**Skills:** Network programming, network architecture, network protocols, FTP, creating and configuring small networks,
